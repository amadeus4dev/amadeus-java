This API is useful for gaining insight and optimizing the search and shopping experience.

Add support for the [Hotel Booking API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/hotel/api-doc/hotel-booking)

This API is in currently in beta and only returns accurate data for airports located in the U.S.
