The API also returns pricing for ancillary products (additional bags, extra legroom, etc.) and the payment information details needed for booking.

Add support for the [Flight Create Orders API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/air/api-doc/flight-create-orders)

> The Flight Create Orders API is a flight booking API that lets you perform the final booking for a desired flight and ancillary products (additional bags, extra legroom, etc.). The API returns a unique ID for the flight order and reservation details. This API is used to perform the final booking on confirmed fares returned by the Flight Offers Price API.

Add support for the [Flight Order Management API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/air/api-doc/flight-order-management)

> The Flight Order Management API lets you consult bookings created through the Flight Create Orders API. Using the booking ID generated by Flight Create Orders, Flight Order Management returns the last-updated version of the booking record with any post-booking modifications including but not limited to ticket information, form of payment or other remarks.

Add support for the [Trip Purpose Prediction API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/trip/api-doc/trip-purpose-prediction)

> The Trip Purpose Prediction API returns the probability of whether a round-trip flight itinerary is for business or leisure travel. The API takes flight dates, departure city and arrival city and then applies a machine-learning model trained with Amadeus historical data to determine the probability that the itinerary is for business or leisure travel. This API is useful for gaining insight and optimizing the search and shopping experience.

Add support for the [Hotel Booking API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/hotel/api-doc/hotel-booking)

> The Amadeus Hotel Booking API lets you complete bookings at over 150,000 hotels and accommodations around the world. To complete bookings, you must first use the Amadeus Hotel Search API to search for hotel deals, select the desired offer and confirm the final price and availability. You can then use the Hotel Booking API to complete the reservation by providing an offer id, guest information and payment information.

Add support for the [AI-Generated Photos API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/trip/api-doc/ai-generated-photos)

> The AI-Generated Photos API returns a link to download a rendered image of a landscape. The image size is 512x512 pixels and the currently available image categories are BEACH and MOUNTAIN. The link to download the AI-generated picture is valid for 24 hours. This API is an experimental project created by the Amadeus AI Lab using the Nvidia StyleGAN framework. This API is free to use and we welcome any feedback you may have about improvements.

Add support for the [SeatMap Display API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/air/api-doc/seatmap-display)

> SeatMap Display API allows you to get information to display airplane cabin plan from a Flight Offer in order for the traveler to be able to choose his seat during the flight booking flow thanks to POST method. In addition GET method allows you to display airplane cabin plan from an existing Flight Order.

Remove support for Most Searched Destinations

Add support for Points of Interest Retrieve endpoint 

Add support for the [Airport on Time API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/air/api-doc/airport-on-time-performance)

> The Airport On-Time Performance API returns the estimated percentage of on-time flight departures for a given airport and date. The API receives the 3-letter IATA airport code and departure date and applies a machine-learning model trained with Amadeus historical data to estimate the overall airport on-time performance. This API is in currently in beta and only returns accurate data for airports located in the U.S.

Add support for the [Flight Delay Prediction API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/air/api-doc/flight-delay-prediction)

> The Flight Delay Prediction API returns the probability that a given flight will be delayed by four possible delay lengths: less than 30 minutes, 30-60 minutes, 60-120 minutes and over 120 minutes/cancellation. The API receives flight information and applies a machine-learning model trained with Amadeus historical data to determine the probability of flight delay.
